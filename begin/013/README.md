# Store with VueX

Vuex is the reference state manager plug-in coupled to Vue. It is similar to Redux for react.
To understand Vuex, it is necessary to be aware of the official schema:

* The state which is the unique and centralized state tree of the data.

* The mutation functions that we've seen alter the data

* actions that actuate mutations.
